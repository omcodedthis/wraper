# wraper
A web scraper written in Java. Due to X (formerly known as Twitter) removing Legacy Twitter, it is difficult to create a twitter profile scraper. This project will be adapted to scrape other websites which will be decided soon. 

Wraper is now a program that can extract various details from a webpage and create a .txt file with these details. These details can be viewed manually but can also be passed to GPT / any form of Generative AI to parse and create a summary with these details provided in the .txt file.

## EDIT: This will be converted to a webpage text extractor in the coming weeks.
## WORK IN PROGRESS!

# wraper
Wraper is now a program that can extract various details and create a summary of a webpage. With the use of [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), the details parsed is parsed to [Orca Mini](https://ollama.ai/library/orca-mini). This is Ollama's lightest model with 3B paramters, suitable for systems with at least 8GB of RAM. Other, more resource-reliant models can also be added, but for the sake of accessbility, Orca Mini was utilised.
